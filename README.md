# System Surveillance using Keylogger

---

### Overview:
This project aims to develop a system surveillance application utilizing keylogger software. The keylogger records keystrokes made by users on a system, providing valuable insights into user activities with the real time screenhots of the screen and audio recording. This README file serves as a guide to understand the project, its functionalities, and how to set it up.

### Features:
1. **Keystroke Logging**: Captures all keystrokes made by users on the system.
2. **Stealth Mode**: Operates discreetly in the background without user intervention or detection.
3. **Scheduled Reports**: Generates reports on user activities at scheduled intervals.
4. **Encryption**: Ensures that logged data remains secure through encryption techniques.
5. **Customization**: Provides options to customize logging settings based on specific requirements.

### Installation:
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. Dependencies might include libraries for keyboard input monitoring and encryption.
3. **Configuration**: Configure settings such as logging interval and report generation preferences.
4. **Compile**: Compile the source code if necessary.
5. **Run the Application**: Execute the compiled application or script to start logging keystrokes.

### Usage:
1. **Start Monitoring**: Once the application is running, it will start monitoring keystrokes silently in the background.
2. **Access Logs**: Access the generated logs either through the application interface or by locating the log files in the designated directory.
3. **Review Reports**: Periodically review the generated reports to analyze user activities on the system.

### Security Considerations:
1. **Data Encryption**: Ensure that all logged data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Secure Storage**: Store logged data and encryption keys in secure locations to prevent leakage.
3. **Permissions**: Set appropriate permissions to restrict access to the application and log files.
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding surveillance and data privacy.

### Contributing:
Contributions to the project are welcome! You can contribute by:
- Reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements through the issue tracker.
- Submitting pull requests to address existing issues or add new features.
- Providing feedback on the project's functionality and usability.
